 abstract = {The objective of this study is to verify the anatomic correlate of the second (2nd) outer retina band in optical coherence tomography (OCT), and to demonstrate the potential of using intrinsic optical signal (IOS) imaging for concurrent optoretinography (ORG) of phototransduction activation and energy metabolism in stimulus activated retinal photoreceptors. A custom-designed OCT was employed for depth-resolved IOS imaging in mouse retina activated by a visible light flicker stimulation. The spatiotemporal properties of the IOS changes at the photoreceptor outer segment (OS) and inner segment (IS) were quantitatively evaluated. Rapid IOS change was observed at the OS almost right away, and the IOS at the IS was relatively slow. Comparative analysis indicates that the OS-IOS reflects transient OS deformation caused by the phototransduction activation, and IS-IOS might reflect the energy metabolism caused by mitochondria activation in retinal photoreceptors. The consistency of the distribution of the IS-IOS and the 2nd OCT band supports the IS ellipsoid (ISe), which has abundant mitochondria, as the signal source of the 2nd OCT band of the outer retina.},
