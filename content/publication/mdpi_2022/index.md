abstract: "A better study of postnatal retinal development is essential for the in-depth understanding of the nature of the vision system. To date, quantitative analysis of postnatal retinal development is primarily limited to endpoint histological examination. This study is to validate in vivo optical coherence tomography (OCT) for longitudinal monitoring of postnatal retinal development in developing mouse eyes. OCT images of C57BL/6J mice were recorded from postnatal day (P) 14 to P56. Three-dimensional (3D) frame registration and super averaging were adopted to investigate the fine structure of the retina. Quantitative OCT analysis revealed distinct outer and inner retinal layer changes, corresponding to eye development. At the outer retina, external limiting membrane (ELM) and ellipsoid zone (EZ) band intensities gradually increased with aging, and the IZ band was detectable by P28. At the inner retina, a hyporeflective layer (HRL) between the nerve fiber layer (NFL) and inner plexiform layer (IPL) was observed in developing eyes and gradually disappeared with aging. Further image analysis revealed individual RGCs within the HRL layer of the young mouse retina. However, RGCs were merged with the NFL and the IPL in the aged mouse retina. Moreover, the sub-IPL layer structure was observed to be gradually enhanced with aging. To interpret the observed retinal layer kinetics, a model based on eyeball expansion, cell apoptosis, and retinal structural modification was proposed."
