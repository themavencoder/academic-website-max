 abstract = {Intrinsic optical signal (IOS) imaging promises a noninvasive method for objective assessment of retinal function. This study demonstrates concurrent optical coherence tomography (OCT) of amplitude-IOS and phase-IOS changes in human photoreceptors. A new procedure for differential-phase-mapping (DPM) is validated to enable depth-resolved phase-IOS imaging. Dynamic OCT revealed rapid amplitude-IOS and phase-IOS changes, which occur almost right away after the stimulus onset. These IOS changes were predominantly observed within the photoreceptor outer segment (OS), particularly two boundaries connecting to the inner segment and retinal pigment epithelium. The comparative analysis supports that both amplitude-IOS and phase-IOS attribute to transient OS morphological change associated with phototransduction activation in retinal photoreceptors. A simulation modeling is proposed to discuss the relationship between the photoreceptor OS length and phase-IOS changes.},
