I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in Biomedical Engineering at [University of Illinois at Chicago](https://www.uic.edu). My research focuses on functional Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) of retinal neurovasculature, exploring the potential to transform our understanding of retinal diseases and develop innovative diagnostic and treatment methods. 

I have a strong interdisciplinary background, having earned by Bachelor's degree from Nankai University and my Master's degree in Polymer Chemistry from a top Chinese university. This diverse academic foundation allows me approach biomedical challenges from unique perspectives and integrate chemistry and materials science into my research. 

Before starting my PhD, I was a dedicated science teacher with experience in teaching college-level courses in chemistry, biology, physics, geography and mathematics. I am passionate about inspiring the next generation of scientists and researchers through effective teaching and mentorship.

At [University of Illinois at Chicago](https://www.uic.edu), I am part of the [Biomedical Optics and Ophthalmic Imaging Laboratory](https://yaolab.bioe.uic.edu/), mentored by my PI, [Professor Xincheng Yao](https://yaolab.bioe.uic.edu/dr-yao/) while working closely with fellow researchers and faculty members. I have published numerous papers and presented my research at various scientific conferences, demonstrating my commitment to advancing the field of retinal neurovasculature research. 

I am eager to continue my research journey and collaborate with other professionals in my field. Please feel free to explore my website for more information on my research, publications, and teaching experiences.
