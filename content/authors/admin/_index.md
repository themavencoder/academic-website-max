I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in Biomedical Engineering at [University of Illinois at Chicago](https://www.uic.edu). My research focuses on functional Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) of retinal neurovasculature, exploring the potential to transform our understanding of retinal diseases and develop innovative diagnostic and treatment methods. 

Before starting my PhD, I was a dedicated science teacher with experience in teaching college-level courses in chemistry, biology, physics, geography and mathematics. I am passionate about inspiring the next generation of scientists and researchers through effective teaching and mentorship. I earned both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Polymer Chemistry from Nankai University, a prestigious institution in China. This solid academic foundation, combined with my diverse teaching experience, equips me with the ability to approach biomedical challenges from distinctive perspectives, seamlessly integrating my previous qualifications into my research. 


At [University of Illinois at Chicago](https://www.uic.edu), I am part of the [Biomedical Optics and Ophthalmic Imaging Laboratory](https://yaolab.bioe.uic.edu/), mentored by my PI, [Professor Xincheng Yao](https://yaolab.bioe.uic.edu/dr-yao/) while working closely with fellow researchers and faculty members. I have published numerous papers and presented my research at various scientific conferences, demonstrating my commitment to advancing the field of retinal neurovasculature research. 

I am eager to continue my research journey and collaborate with other professionals in my field. Please feel free to explore my website for more information on my research, publications, and teaching experiences.
